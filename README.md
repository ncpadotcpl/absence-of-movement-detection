**The following are the variables which need to be changed:**
- username: The username for the RTSP stream authentication.
- password: The password for the RTSP stream authentication.
- rtsp_url: The RTSP stream URL, which incorporates the encoded username and password.

If you are having issues it might be worth changing this variable.
- no_movement_time_threshold: The time threshold (in seconds) for detecting no movement (10 seconds in the example).
